# Unity3D Zombie Survival Game  

## 🎮 Overview  
A zombie survival shooter built in **Unity3D (C#)** as part of my Software Engineering degree coursework.  

The project demonstrates core game development principles: AI-driven enemies, player combat systems, multiple weapons, UI integration, and asset management. It was developed independently to showcase **problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and gameplay system design**.

## ✨ Features  
- **Player Systems**  
  - Smooth third-person movement and camera control.  
  - Health bar, damage, and respawn mechanics.  

- **Enemy AI**  
  - Multiple zombie types (default, armored, captain, girl, etc.).  
  - Attack, chase, and death animations.  
  - Increasing wave-based difficulty.  

- **Combat & Weapons**  
  - Pistols, shotgun, different rifles, Uzi, and machine gun.  
  - Ammo tracking, reload system, and weapon switching.   

- **UI & Game Flow**  
  - Main menu and HUD (health, ammo, score, enemies left).  
  - Game over and wave progression.  

- **Visuals**    
  - TextMesh Pro for modern UI text.  
  - Mix of custom and third-party models/textures.

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samuel-Boomdijk/Unity3D-Game-Project.git
   
2. Open the project in Unity Hub.
- Recommended version: Unity 2022.3 LTS or later (but should work in newer versions).

3. Open the startScene from the Assets/Scenes folder.

4. Press Play in the Unity editor to start the game.

## 🔑 Key Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- Building a fully functioning Unity3D game loop from scratch.
- Implementing AI-driven gameplay using Unity’s NavMesh and scripting.
- Designing and integrating a wave-based survival system.
- Applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#.
- Managing large assets and version control with Git and Git LFS.

# Unity3D Zombie Survival Game  

## üéÆ Overview  
A zombie survival shooter built in **Unity3D (C#)** as part of my Software Engineering degree coursework.  

The project demonstrates core game development principles: AI-driven enemies, player combat systems, multiple weapons, UI integration, and asset management. It was developed independently to showcase **problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and gameplay system design**.
